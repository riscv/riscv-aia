==Preface

This document describes an Advanced Interrupt Architecture for RISC-V
systems. This specification was ratified by the RISC-V International
Association in June of 2023.

The table below indicates which chapters of this document specify
extensions to the RISC-V ISA (instruction set architecture) and which
are non-ISA.

[cols="<,^",options="header",]
|===
|Chapter |ISA?
|1. Introduction |—
|2. Control and Status Registers (CSRs) Added to Harts |Yes
|3. Incoming MSI Controller (IMSIC) |Yes
|4. Advanced Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (APLIC) |No
|5. Interrupts for Machine and Supervisor Levels |Yes
|6. Interrupts for Virtual Machines (VS Level) |Yes
|7. Interprocessor Interrupts (IPIs) |No
|8. IOMMU Support for MSIs to Virtual Machines |No
|===

*Changes for the ratified version 1.0*

Resolved some inconsistencies in <<CSRs>> about when to raise
a virtual instruction exception versus an illegal instruction exception.

*Changes for RC6 (Ratification Candidate 6)*

Resolved some inconsistencies in <<CSRs>> about when to raise
a virtual instruction exception versus an illegal instruction exception.

*Changes for RC5*

Better aligned the rules for indirectly accessed registers with the
hypervisor extension and with forthcoming extension Smcsrind/Sscsrind.
In particular, when `vsiselect` has a reserved value, attempts to
access `sireg` from a virtual machine (VS or VU-mode) should
preferably raise an illegal instruction exception instead of a virtual
instruction exception.

Added clarification about the term _IOMMU_ used in <<IOMMU>>.

Added clarification about MSI write replaced by MRIF update and notice
MSI sent after the update.

*Changes for RC4*

For alignment with other forthcoming RISC-V ISA extensions, the widths
of the indirect-access CSRs, `miselect`, `mireg`, `siselect`,
`sireg`, `vsiselect`, and `vsireg`, were changed to all be the
current XLEN rather than being tied to their respective privilege levels
(previously MXLEN for `miselect` and `mireg`, SXLEN for `siselect`
and `sireg`, and VSXLEN for `vsiselect` and `vsireg`).

Changed the description (but not the actual function) of _high-half_
CSRs and their partner CSRs to match the latest RISC-V Privileged ISA
specification. (An example of a high-half CSR is `miph`, and its
partner here is `mip`.)

*Changes for RC3*

Removed the still-draft Duo-PLIC chapter to a separate document.

Allocated major interrupts 35 and 43 for signaling RAS events
(<<majorIntrs>>).

In <<virtIntrs-S>> added the options for bits 1 and 9 to
be writable in CSR `mvien`, and specified the effects of setting each
of these bits.

Upgraded <<IOMMU>> ("IOMMU Support") to the _frozen_ state.

*Changes for RC2*

Clarified that field IID of CSR `hvictl` must support all unsigned
integer values of the number of bits implemented for that field, and
that writes to `hvictl` always set IID in the most straightforward
way.

A comment was added to <<IPIs>> warning about the possible
need for FENCE instructions when IPIs are sent to other harts by writing
MSIs to those harts' IMSICs.
